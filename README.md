# ZEUS: A One Handed Keeb Made For Speed
**No extra keys. Only essentials. Built for speed, precision, and one-handed precession.**
## Why ZEUS?
Zeus has a custom layout designed for speed and efficiency. This is based on a generic one handed gaming board.. yeah the kind you get on alibaba. BUT!! the diffrence is instead of keys numeric or function keys it has all alphabet keys. This make it perfect for speed typists.
## How Do I Flash ZEUS?
WHY WOULD YOU WANNA FLASH A GOD WHO HAS A HISTORY OF ADULTRY AND CREATING DEMIGODS. /j
But in all seriousness you just need to get the firmware and then just flash the code through any ide.
